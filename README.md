Sample sklearn workflow for a dataset with numerical and categorical data

I use the HistGradientBoostingClassifier model to classify the sklearn covtype dataset.
This repo focuses mostly on selecting the optimal feature selection strategies and preprocessing steps using GridSearchCV.
I didn't do much dataset exploration about the relationships between variables before developing the model, but the Titanic repo does have more of this type of work.
